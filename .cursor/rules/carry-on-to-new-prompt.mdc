# Current State of the Project

Format this as 3 concise paragraphs, where you describe what we just did, what did not work, which files were updated/created, what mistakes to avoid, any key insights/lessons we've learned, what problems/errors we are facing, and anything else a programmer might need to work productively on this project.

Write in a conversational yet informative tone.
Such as a README file on GitHub that is information rich and without any fluff or noise.

Do **NOT** include any assumptions or theories, just the facts.
